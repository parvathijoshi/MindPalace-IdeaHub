# Internship Project: Idea Hub - Team Mind Palace (Group 13)

## Mind Palace

**Description:**  
A centralized website where anyone within a company can post their innovative ideas.

### Vision:
To create a central hub for submitting and viewing ideas within the company, promoting innovation and collaboration. Individuals will be able to submit their ideas and discover if others may have similar ideas that they are already working on. Ideas will be filterable by business area, topic, skill set, and more.

### What Success Looks Like:
We will be successful if there is a high level of awareness within the company regarding ideas and the initiatives being worked on, including who is championing them. Additionally, we aim for users to quickly search and find ideas within business areas or by topic, allowing them to identify similar ideas that may already be in development.
